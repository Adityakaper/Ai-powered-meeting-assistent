  "transcript": " Today's meeting is very important. We have, I guess, the seven very powerful leaders from  Europe and we're going to be meeting with them right after this meeting and thank you very  much for being here. We supported the idea of the United States of  Barcelona President Trump to stop this war, to make a diplomatic way of finishing this war  and we are ready for trilateral as President Saad. This is good signal about trilateral. I think  this is very good. Thank you. I don't think you made a ceasefire. You know, if you look at the six  deals that I settled this year, they were all in war. I didn't do any ceasefires and I know that  it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically, well, you know, one country or  the other wouldn't want it. We just spoke to, I was just telling the President, I just spoke to  President Putin indirectly and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today.  The Alaska Summit reinforced my belief that while difficult pieces within reach, and I believe  that, in a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security  guarantees for Ukraine and this is one of the key points that we need to consider and we're  going to be considering that at the table also. Like, who will do what essentially? I'm optimistic  that collectively we can reach an agreement that would deter any future aggression against Ukraine  and I actually think there won't be. I think that's even overrated, largely overrated, but we're  going to find out. And that is, I think if we play this well, we could end this. And we have to  end. If we have to stop the killing, we have to stop the destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure.  It is a terrible war, so I'm really excited. And let's make the best out of today and make sure  that from today onwards, we get this thing to announce as soon as possible.  The next steps ahead are the more complicated ones now. The path is open. You opened it last Friday,  but now the way is open for complicated negotiations. And to be honest, we all would like to see  a ceasefire and the latest from the next meeting on. I can't imagine that the next meeting  would took place without a ceasefire. So let's work on that and let's try to put pressure on Russia.  In the six wars that I've settled, I haven't had a ceasefire. We just got into negotiations and the  one of the wars was, as you know, in the Congo was 30 years, 31 years long. Another one that we  settled last week with two great countries was 35 years going on, and we had no ceasefire. So  if we can do the ceasefire great, and if we don't do a ceasefire, because many other points were  given to us, many, many points were given to us great points, and we'll journey together,  and we'll go over and we'll see if it can be done. And it's possible it might not be able to  be done. On the other hand, it's possible it will, and we're going to save thousands and  thousands of lives a week. And so it's something we really have to do. Or at least we have to give  it our best. It's all you can do. You can give it your best, but I think we may have a very good  outcome.",
