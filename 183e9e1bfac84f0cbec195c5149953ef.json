  "transcript": " Hello everyone, thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting and let's just get started.  So I have our list of chronically absent students here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.  A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?  I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.  It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.  I think that's a great idea. Let's try that next week.  Let's get started.",
